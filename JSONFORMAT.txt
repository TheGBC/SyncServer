// These are example JSON formats. There are 2 main type of commands: ACTION and POLL

ACTION  specifies a velocity and position of a JSON Object that was created, along with the timestamp that JSON Object was created with. An example JSON is as follows:
{
  "type": "add",
  "action": {
    "timestamp": "12345",
    "velocity": {
      "x": 1123,
      "y": 256,
      "z": 464
    },
    "position": {
      "x": 1.123,
      "y": 2.56,
      "z": 4.64
    }
  }
}

POLL asks the servers for all JSON objects stored between two timestamps. It looks as so:
{
  "type": "poll",
  "start": 0,
  "end": 100
}

Be aware that the server code automatically adds 1500 milliseconds to any request made(as of 7/17/2014)
